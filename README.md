## Preparation and Requirements
##### Mandatory:
- Nessla with Electrsynthesis, Lure equipped and Chain Lightning as first move
- Nessla needs to be the second Tem to get hit by Chain Lightning
- at least 1 Tem that needs to be trained on first spot
- TV trained Tem needs to have a super cheap first move that can be used every round

##### Recommended:
- LVL 58 Nessla with max Stats
- 99 TemCards in case you use throwing Cards on Luma
- Proteins on first Tem and Cowards Cloak on last one
- A Spot with a 100% encounter rate of the same Tem

## LUA Settings
You have the option to change a few Settings inside the LUA. These are found directly on top of the script:

##### Movement Options
   1. Up/Down - Unsafe Movement
   2. Curved Movement - Does a curve when changing directions
   3. Maevement - A Mix between Random, Circle and Curved Movements
   4. Left/Right - Unsafe Movement
   
##### Luma Options
   1. Wait on Luma - Stops the script and waits for User input
   2. Disconnect on Luma - Stops the script and closes the game
   3. Throwing Cards on Luma - Throwing cards until Luma is caught and continues the script
   
##### Number of Tems to train TV
   - You have to change the number according to the Temtems you want to TV train
   - min 1, max 5
   
##### Number of enemies to kill for desired TV
   - This is the amount of kills that your Tem needs to get the desired TV
   - max should be 500 when using no Proteins, 250 if you use Proteins
   - Example: You want 100 TV in Speed, you fight on an 100% Skail (1 TV per kill) Spot, and have Proteins(double TV per kill) equipped, so you need to make it 50
   - It is possible that it kills 1 or 2 Tems too much. If it is important to you to have the exact desired TV, make it about 4-5 less and kill the last few Tems by yourself

##### Your VM Name or Number
   - This is only for Telegram notification if you have multiple VM's to know which VM found a Luma
   - Set the Name your VM is called, needs to be inside the "", for example `vm = "TemBot VM Nr 3"`
   
##### Continuous Notifications to Telegram
   - Set this to '1' if you wish to get every now and then a Status Notification on Telegram 
   
##### Using Proteins as Gear?
   - Set this to '1' if you have your first Temtem equipped with Proteins
   - You need to unequip everything else on all other Tem except Nessla and the last Tem if you use Cowards Cloak
      
##### Using Cowards Cloak as Gear?
   - Set this to '1' if you have the last Tem equipped with the Cowards Cloak
